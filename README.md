Homebrew plasma cutter torch height controller
--------------------------------------------------

Schematics, layout and code for a simple yet intelligent replacement for THC301d
torch height controller.

The main difference is that this one samples cutting voltage automatically
after cut is started, and then tries to keep the plasma torch at the same
height.

Beware- this has only been tested for a few hours as of now, but the results
seem to be as good as with THC301d (but setpoint is determined automatically).
